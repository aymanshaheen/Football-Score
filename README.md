 cd football-app

Install dependencies:

```
Run the app:

```

## Keep in mind

- The app hasn't been tested on IOS devices (even an emulator) as of yet, since I don't have a Mac, which is required to build an actual executable file. The app itself doesn't have any platform-specific code, though there are a couple of dependencies that do. I configured them according to the instructions, so the app should work fine on both Android and IOS.
